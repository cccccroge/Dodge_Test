# Note
This is a test project for Godot Engine 3.0.6. And the main
purpose is to learn how to arrange nodes to orgnize scenes,
and also to figure out what's the better solution to a 
specific game structure. 
(responsibility, depth of scene tree...etc.)

# Usage
There's no reason to export to a game now, but you can
examine the scenes and code structure by using 
Godot Engine 3.0.6 to edit the game project. Or you can
simply see the test conclusion below.

# Conclusion
feel free to give feedback if you're interested or have 
advice for specific things.
